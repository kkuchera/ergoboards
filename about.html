<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Finding the perfect keyboard is not easy, there are a ton of options to choose from. Do I want a split or non-split design? Should it be tended and/or contoured? Cherry, Alps, Topre or buckling spring switches? Once I've figured that out, the question becomes what keyboards fulfil my requirements? That is where ergoboards.com comes in. We have a database of over 100 quality keyboards that can easily be searched with a wide variety of search criteria in order to find the ideal keyboard based on your requirements.

<h2>What?</h2>
<p>A searchable database of ergonomic keyboards. Ergonomic is used in a very broad sense of the word.
